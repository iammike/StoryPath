# Product Mission (Lite)

StoryPath is an interactive storytelling iOS app that helps parents and young children experience classic fairy tales and folk stories together by providing choose-your-own-adventure narratives with multiple branching paths while preserving the original story as an authentic reading option.

StoryPath serves parents with young children (ages 3-10) who want engaging, interactive story experiences without simplified vocabulary. Unlike traditional storybook apps, StoryPath preserves the rich language of classic public domain tales while adding interactive branching narratives, always maintaining one path that follows the authentic original story.
