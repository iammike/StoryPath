# [2025-10-05] Recap: Story Content Parser

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/story-content-parser/

## Recap

Implemented the core story content parsing system for StoryPath with the following components:

- **StoryLoader service** - JSON loading, validation, and caching for story files
- **StoryRepository service** - High-level story management with filtering, searching, and sorting using Combine publishers
- **Comprehensive test suite** - 11 tests covering all functionality (all passing)
- **Sample story content** - Complete Little Red Riding Hood story with branching paths

Key accomplishments:
- Bundle resource loading working correctly in both app and tests
- Validation catches structural issues (broken references, unreachable segments, missing authentic paths)
- Repository provides flexible filtering by tags, age range, culture, and purchase status
- Iterative segment validation (no stack overflow risk)

## Context

From spec-lite.md:

Build the core content parsing and management system for StoryPath that loads, validates, and manages JSON-formatted interactive story files. The system provides story loading with validation, caching for performance, and a repository service for filtering, searching, and sorting story collections.
