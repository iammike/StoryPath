# Story Content Parser - Spec Summary

## Overview
Build the core content parsing and management system for StoryPath that loads, validates, and manages JSON-formatted interactive story files.

## User Story
As a parent using StoryPath, I need the app to reliably load and validate story content so that I can experience interactive stories with my children without encountering broken paths or missing content.

## Key Features
1. **Story Loading** - Load individual or all story JSON files from the app bundle
2. **Story Validation** - Validate story structure including segment references, authentic paths, and reachability
3. **Caching System** - Cache loaded stories to improve performance
4. **Story Repository** - High-level service for filtering, searching, and sorting story collections
5. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error handling for file access and JSON parsing

## Technical Approach
- `StoryLoader`: Singleton service handling JSON parsing, validation, and caching
- `StoryRepository`: ObservableObject for managing story collections with filtering/searching
- Integration with existing Story data model
- Async/await for file I/O operations
- Comprehensive unit test coverage

## Success Criteria
- All stories load successfully from bundle
- Validation catches structural issues (broken references, unreachable segments, missing authentic paths)
- Cache improves repeat load performance
- Repository provides flexible filtering and search
- 100% test coverage for core functionality

## Dependencies
- Story data model (completed in previous PR)
- Swift 6 with async/await
- SwiftUI for Observable pattern

## Out of Scope
- UI components for displaying stories
- Audio playback integration
- Progress tracking/bookmarks
- Remote story downloads
